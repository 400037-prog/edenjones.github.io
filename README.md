<p>Summary:</p>
<p> A federal judge ruled that former President Donald Trump illegally deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles during protests in June. The decision, hailed as a victory by Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, found the Trump administration violated federal law by using troops alongside federal agents in immigration raids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote that such deployments raise concerns about the creation of a national police force under presidential control, a direct violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement.</p>
